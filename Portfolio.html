<h4>MY FACTS</h4>

<p>
    ~ I'm not a great programmer, am just a good programmer with great habits
    <br>
    ~Coding like poetry should be short and concise.
    <br>
    ~It’s not a bug; it’s an undocumented feature.
    <br>
    ~First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.
    <br>
    ~Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.
    <br>
    ~Make it work, make it right, make it fast.
    <br>
    ~Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
    <br>
    ~Of course, bad code can be cleaned up. But it’s very expensive.
    <br>
    ~Programming is the art of algorithm design and the craft of debugging errant code.
    <br>
    ~Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
    <br>
    ~Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
    <br>
    ~Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.
    <br>
    ~Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do.
    <br>
    ~Confusion is part of programming.
    <br>
    ~No matter which field of work you want to go in, it is of great importance to learn at least one programming language.
